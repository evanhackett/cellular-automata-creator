# Cellular Automata Creator

Users can enter a function which will define the rules of a cellular automata.
Looping through the grid, coloring cells, and getting neighboring cells are abstracted away.

To start the dev environment, run the following in the root directory:

    npm start

That will watch js files and build with browserify.
